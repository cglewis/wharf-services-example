Elasticsearch allows you to get started easily. Toss it a JSON document and it will try to detect the data structure, index the data and make it searchable.  Later, apply your domain specific knowledge of your data to customize how your data is indexed. Elasticsearch allows you to start small, but will grow with your business. It is built to scale horizontally out of the box. As you need more capacity, just add more nodes, and let the cluster reorganize itself to take advantage of the extra hardware.
